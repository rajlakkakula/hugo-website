abstract: Asymmetric information is prevalent in the grain and oilseed markets. This paper demonstrates the benefits of blockchain technology to mitigate asymmetric information about the soybean's protein quality between sellers and buyers. We use decision trees to model information asymmetry under both conventional and blockchain scenarios. The results suggest that asymmetric information can be mitigated with a blockchain, resulting in substantial premiums (40 to 60 cents per bushel of soybeans). These results could have significant implications for the grain and oilseed industry in order to decrease transaction costs, to improve market efficiency, and to prioritize strategies for the procurement of soybeans.
