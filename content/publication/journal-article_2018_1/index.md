abstract: Obesity is a complex health issue in the United States of America (USA) and around the world. The sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) tax has become a popular health policy tool among public representatives to reduce the intake of SSBs. This article proposes three different strategies for an effective and comprehensive health policy with a goal to reduce excess sweetener consumption to an extent that it could have an impact on public health. Strategies include (1) a tax on sweeteners as inputs instead of a tax on final products (outputs) such as sugary drinks/SSBs, (2) specifying added sugars in the nutrition facts label with %Daily Value (%DV) based on the American Heart Associationâ€™s (or based on similar health organizations in individual countries) recommended sweetener consumption per capita, per day, and (3) educating the public regarding the negative health consequences of consuming excess sweeteners.
