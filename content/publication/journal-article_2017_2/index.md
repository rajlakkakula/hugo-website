abstract: This article identifies the causal relationships among the prices of five fertilizers using both asymptotic Wald test and resampling (bootstrap) techniques. Monthly data for urea, muriate of potash, rock phosphate, diammonium phosphate and triple super phosphate between 2008 (March) and 2016 (March) are used for the analysis. Results show that the urea price Granger causes all other fertilizer prices. The results of the study are significant in understanding the price dynamics and identify the reference fertilizer price that is useful for the fertilizer industry, farmers and government.
