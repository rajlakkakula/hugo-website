abstract: Blockchain is a special type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) that enables verifying and recording peer-to-peer transactions in a distributed, append-only and immutable fashion. In this chapter, we describe applications of blockchain technology which focus on the current challenges or issues in some key sectors of agriculture as well as how blockchain technology could be beneficial in addressing those challenges. Finally, we discuss some limitations of blockchain technology.
